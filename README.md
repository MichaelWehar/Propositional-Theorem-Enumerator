# Background

A statement in propositional calculus might be a tautology, a contradiction, or neither.  If it is a tautology, then that means is has a proof.  That is, there is a sequence of applications of inference rules and axioms that leads you to the tautology.

But, is there a short proof?  How many theorems have short proofs?

There are many different axiom systems for propositional calculus.  Whether or not a theorem has a short proof may depend on the axiom system that is used.  In addition, the number of theorems with short proofs may vary with the axiom system.

Take a look at some example axiom systems: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_systems

Also, take a look at GÃ¶del's speed-up theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_speed-up_theorem

# What is this project?

We carry out a sort of unification on propositional formulas to create a grammer for generating/enumerating tautologies.

See here for information on the unification algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unification_(computer_science)

# Why does it matter?

(1) Determining whether or not a propositional formula is a tautology is a classical coNP-complete problem.

Information on coNP: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-NP-complete

The problem of factoring an integer is in coNP.  This suggests that the tautology problem might be harder than factoring.

(2) A probabilistic version of this enumerator was used to create hard instance benchmarks for the tautology problem.
